# Turkish License Plate Recognition System (YOLOv8)

This project is a license plate detection system for Turkish cars, built using the YOLOv8 object detection architecture.

## 🔍 Purpose

The aim of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting Turkish license plates using a YOLOv8-based model and to provide a foundational example for similar applications. This project is shared solely for **educational, research, and experimental** purposes.

## 📷 About the Training Data

The model was trained using images of cars and license plates obtained from various sources on the internet, primarily Google Images.

> **Disclaimer:** Most of these images were publicly available and their copyright/licensing status was not clearly specified.  
> None of the images used in training have been used for commercial or distribution purposes.  
> This project is strictly for personal learning and research use. **The training dataset is not included** in this repository.
